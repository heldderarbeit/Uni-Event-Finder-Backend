## Run the sever    
Use `npm install` to download dependencies before run the server.  
If you want to connect to mongdb local database, please download and install it in your computer (Refer to: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/); if you want to use cloud database: just replace the `dbUrl` in `/config/config.default.js` to your own database connect url.  
Run the command `nodemon app.js` to start the server, and navigate to `http://localhost:3600`.
